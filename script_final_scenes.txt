Twilight Sparkle

You go there during the evening.
Twilight wonders where Spike went, you think a bit and answer that he went to Rarity's house to help here with some special late night event
She invites you to see the stars with you instead.
You sit with her and the telescope and whaaa. A big moon.
Twilight explains some stuff about the moon.
She ends up looking at you, analysing you and leans for a kiss.
THE END

MOON MOON WOOT

Rarity

You go there, Rarity is venting herself.
You need to find some ice, she's all red.
She starts wanting to rape the player.
You can try to flee or confront her, false choice, you can't escape.
Sudden quizz urge before the naughty.
Naughty off-screen.
THE END

Fluttershy

She turns out to be a control freak and she ligotate you to a tree.
